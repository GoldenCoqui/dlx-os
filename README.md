# dlx-os
DLX OS project
For my CS314 (Operating System) course we improved on a old operating system called DLX-os
We used C to make improvements like adding bash features like copy, cat, and grep.

There were 3 main projects this is what they are
- Project 1 = Adding getPID() by adding appropraite traps and processes
- Project 2 = Improving the processing system from Roudn Robin to a lottery system
- Project 3 = Creating a file system (Unix similar)
